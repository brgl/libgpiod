/**
 * @mainpage libgpiod public API
 *
 * This is the complete documentation of the public API made available to
 * users of libgpiod.
 *
 * <p>The public header is logically split into two high-level parts: the
 * simple API and the low-level API. The former allows users to easily
 * interact with the GPIOs in the system without dealing with the low-level
 * data structures and resource control. The latter gives the user much more
 * fine-grained control over the GPIO interface.
 *
 * <p>The low-level API is further logically split into several parts such
 * as: GPIO chip & line operators, iterators, GPIO events handling etc.
 *
 * <p>General note on error handling: all routines exported by libgpiod  set
 * errno to one of the error values defined in errno.h upon failure. The way
 * of notifying the caller that an error occurred varies between functions,
 * but in general a function that returns an int, returns -1 on error, while
 * a function returning a pointer bails out on error condition by returning
 * a NULL pointer.
