      RequestLines:
      @line_config: Line configuration. See below for details.
      @request_config: Request configuration. See below for details.
      @request_path: Object path pointing to the newly added request.

      Requests a set of lines and makes it possible for the users of this API
      to manipulate them depending on the line configuration.

      Line configuration is a tuple of two arrays. The first one contains
      mappings of arrays of line offsets to sets of line settings. The second
      contains the list of default output values which are only used in output
      mode.

      Available line config options:

        "direction" => String representing the line direction. Accepts the
                       following values: "input", "output".
        "edge" => String representing the edge detection setting. Accepts the
                  following values: "falling", "rising", "both".
        "active-low" => Boolean representing the active-low setting.
        "drive" => String representing the drive settings. Accepts the
                   following values: "push-pull", "open-drain", "open-source".
        "bias" => String representing the internal bias settings. Accepts the
                  following values: "disabled", "pull-up", "pull-down", "as-is".
        "debounce-period" => Debounce period in microseconds represented as a
                             signed, 64-bit integer.
        "event-clock" => String representing the clock used to timestamp edge
                         events. Accepts the following values: "monotonic",
                         "realtime", "hte".

      Output values are applied to the lines in the order they appear in the
      settings mappings.

      Example variant that allows to request lines at offsets 1, 5 and 11 in
      output, push-pull and active-low modes and specifies the output values
      as active (as visualized with g_variant_print()):

        // Line config tuple
        (
          // Array of line settings mappings
          [
            // Single mapping tuple
            (
              // Offsets to map
              [1, 5, 11],
              // Line settings dict
              {
                'direction': <'output'>,
                'drive': <'push-pull'>,
                'active-low': <true>
              }
            )
          ],
          // Output values
          [1, 1, 1]
        )

      Request configuration is a hashmap mapping names of the available config
      options to their values wrapped in a variant.

      Available request config options:

        "consumer" => Consumer name as a string
        "event-buffer-size" => Requested size of the in-kernel edge event
                               buffer as an unsigned 32-bit integer.

      The object path to the new request is returned on success. The user
      should wait for it to appear before trying to use the requested lines in
      any way.

      should probably access the line directly using the kernel uAPI.
