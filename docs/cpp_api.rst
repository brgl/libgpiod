libgpiod C++ bindings API
=========================

The **C++ bindings** for **libgpiod** provide a modern C++ wrapper around the
core C API. These bindings make it easier to work with GPIO lines in C++ by
offering an **object-oriented** approach and **RAII** (Resource Acquisition
Is Initialization) principles for managing resources.

.. note::
   C++17 compiler support is required to build the bindings.
