libgpiod Python bindings API
============================

The **libgpiod Python bindings** provide an interface to control and interact
with GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) lines on Linux systems using the
libgpiod library. The Python bindings allow developers to manage GPIO pins
easily through Python scripts, enabling tasks such as reading input values,
setting outputs, monitoring events, and configuring more fine-grained pin
options.

.. note::
   Python bindings require python3 support and libpython development files for
   building from sources.
