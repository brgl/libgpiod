   libgpiod GObject API documentation

libgpiod GObject bindings API
=============================

**GObject bindings** for libgpiod provide a high-level, object-oriented
interface to interact with GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) lines on Linux
systems. These bindings leverage the **GObject framework**, commonly used in
GNOME and GTK+ applications, to wrap the lower-level C API of libgpiod.

.. warning::
   The documentation for GObject bindings is generated using gi-docgen and
   cannot be easily integrated with sphinx documentation. Please navigate to
   a separate section dedicated exclusively to the GLib part of the API.

`Navigate to GObject bindings documentation <Gpiodglib-1.0/index.html>`_
