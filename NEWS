libgpiod v0.3.2
===============

Bug fixes:
- correctly handle signal interrupts when polling in gpiod_simple_event_loop()
- fix the linking order when building with static libraries
- pass the correct consumer string to gpiod_simple_get_value_multiple() in
  gpioget
- fix a line test case: don't use open-drain or open-source flags for input
  mode
- fix the flags passed to ar in order to supress a build warning
- set the last error code in gpiod_chip_open_by_label() to ENOENT if a chip
  can't be found

libgpiod v0.3.1
===============

Bug fixes:
- fix checking the kernel version in the test suite

Improvements:
- re-enable a test case previously broken by a bug in the kernel

This is the first version hosted at kernel.org. README.md has been renamed to
README as the .md file was not being packaged automatically by autotools,
which went unnoticed due to not using 'make dist' until now.

libgpiod v0.3
=============

New features:
- gpiomon can now watch multiple lines at the same time and supports custom
  output formats which can be specified using the --format argument
- testing framework can now test external programs: test cases for gpio-tools
  have been added

Improvements:
- improve error messages
- improve README examples
- configure script improvements

Bug fixes:
- use correct UAPI flags when requesting line events

libgpiod v0.2.1
===============

Bug fixes:
- capitalize 'GPIO' in error messages in gpioset, gpioget & gpiomon
- tweak the error message on invalid arguments in gpiofind
- don't ignore superfluous arguments and fix the displayed name for falling
  edge events in gpiomon

libgpiod v0.2
=============

New features:
- relicensed under LGPLv2.1
- implemented a unit testing framework together with a comprehensive
  set of test cases
- added a non-closing variant of the gpiochip iterator and foreach
  macro [by Clemens Gruber]
- added gpiod_chip_open_by_label()

Improvements:
- Makefiles & build commands have been reworked [by Thierry Reding]
- documentation updates
- code shrinkage here and there
- coding style fixes
- removed all designated initializers from the header for better standards
  compliance

Bug fixes:
- fix the return value of gpiod_simple_event_loop()
- don't try to process docs if doxygen is not installed

libgpiod v0.1.3
===============

Bug fixes:
- this time the bug making it impossible to request both types of line events
  was really fixed
- pass the O_CLOEXEC flag to open() when opening the GPIO chip device file

libgpiod v0.1.2
===============

Bug fixes:
- include <poll.h> instead of <sys/poll.h> in gpioset
- fix a formatting issue in gpioinfo for chips with >100 GPIO lines
- fix a bug when requesting both-edges event notifications

libgpiod v0.1.1
===============

Bug fixes:
- fix short options in gpiomon (short opt for --silent was missing)
- correct the kernel headers requirements in README
- include <time.h> for struct timespec
- include <poll.h> instead of <sys/poll.h>
- detect the version of strerror_r()

libgpiod v0.1
=============

First version of libgpiod.

It's currently possible to:
- get and set the values of multiple GPIO lines with a single function call
- monitor a GPIO line for events
- enumerate all GPIO chips present in the system
- enumerate all GPIO lines exposed by a chip
- extract information about GPIO chips (label, name, number of lines)
- extract information about GPIO lines (name, flags, state, user)

Tools provided with the library are:
- gpioget - read values from GPIO lines
- gpioset - set values of GPIO lines
- gpiodetect - list GPIO chips
- gpioinfo - print info about GPIO lines exposed by a chip
- gpiomon - monitor a GPIO line for events
- gpiofind - find a GPIO line by name
